# PDef-Tracker

Tracker implementation for Supercollider 3.x

## 

Based loosely on ImpulseTracker, the ultimate tracker. This attempt is inspired by the frustration I face when using newer and cooler trackers like Buzz/buze/sunvox. I need something that's entirely controllable via keyboard, or at least most of the major editing/jazzing around features should not require mouse jockeying.

Don't get excited yet, none of this works. If you can still read this message, then it's not even usable yet. I also don't know SuperCollider language intimately yet - that being said UI coding is coming along nicely.

Here's the todo:

**Milestone 0**

- [x] make pattern UI navigatable
- [ ] make data editable (UI and storage issue)

**Milestone 1**

- [ ] make pattern data composable to a Pattern structure
- [ ] make sample display UI ( loop details )
- [ ] make sample amp ADSR 
- [ ] make sample filter ADSR 
- [ ] make sample panning ADSR 
- [ ] make sample bank storage
- [ ] make sample bank loader ui
- [ ] make sample trigger pads (keyboard)

**Milestone 2**

- [ ] represent pattern notes in pianoroll like ui
- [ ] make synthdef/unit loader/bank
- [ ] make node tree view
- [ ] allow hot routing of units

**Milestone 3**

- [ ] ptrk console area, add commands for 
    - [ ] connecting / disconnecting
    - [ ] loading units
    - [ ] loading samples
    - [ ] rerouting units
    - [ ] muting tracks, (single, multiple)
- [ ] 8 bit mask generator
- [ ] 16 bit mask generator, (8 bit repeater with random bitrot on repeated)

If it gets this far more will come.
