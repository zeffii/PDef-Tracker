# PDef-Tracker

Tracker implementation for Supercollider 3.x

## 

Don't get excited yet, none of this works. If you can still read this message, then it's not even usable yet.

Based loosely on ImpulseTracker/Buzz

Here's the todo:

**Milestone 1**

- [ ] make pattern UI navigatable
- [ ] make pattern data composable to a Pattern structure
- [ ] make sample display UI ( loop details )
- [ ] make sample amp ADSR 
- [ ] make sample filter ADSR 
- [ ] make sample panning ADSR 
- [ ] make sample bank storage
- [ ] make sample bank loader ui
- [ ] make sample trigger pads (keyboard )

**Milestone 2**

- [ ] represent pattern notes in pianoroll like ui
- [ ] make synthdef loader/bank

If it gets this far more will come.
