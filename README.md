# PDef-Tracker

Tracker implementation for Supercollider 3.x

## 

Based loosely on ImpulseTracker, the ultimate tracker. This attempt is inspired by the frustration I face when using newer and cooler trackers like Buzz/buze/sunvox. I need something that's entirely controllable via keyboard, or at least most of the major editing/jazzing around features should not require mouse jockeying.

Don't get excited yet, none of this works. If you can still read this message, then it's not even usable yet.

Here's the todo:

**Milestone 1**

- [ ] make pattern UI navigatable
- [ ] make pattern data composable to a Pattern structure
- [ ] make sample display UI ( loop details )
- [ ] make sample amp ADSR 
- [ ] make sample filter ADSR 
- [ ] make sample panning ADSR 
- [ ] make sample bank storage
- [ ] make sample bank loader ui
- [ ] make sample trigger pads (keyboard)

**Milestone 2**

- [ ] represent pattern notes in pianoroll like ui
- [ ] make synthdef/unit loader/bank
- [ ] make node tree view
- [ ] allow hot routing of units

**Milestone 3**

- [ ] ptrk console area, add commands for 
    - [ ] connecting / disconnecting
    - [ ] loading units
    - [ ] loading samples
    - [ ] rerouting units
    - [ ] muting tracks, (single, multiple)

If it gets this far more will come.
